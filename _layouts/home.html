    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>LockTransformLib will be a Concurrency Library with different implementations of mutexes, condition variables, semaphores and readers-writers locks.</p> 
    <p>I will be analysing their performance along parameters such as fairness, average latency and processor utilization with implementations of different data structures using a test suite consisting of varying workloads.</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>Common multi-threaded programs have areas of contention where different threads need to access / modify a shared data structure. In such cases, concurrency management objects like locks are used. I have used those implemented for use with Pthreads and OpenMP constructs as well as implemented these in both user- and kernel-space in 15-410.</p>
    <p>There are three main requirements for a critical section that we can use to evaluate such an object for example, a mutex:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mutual Exclusion</li>
      <li>Progress</li>
      <li>Bounded Waiting</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
